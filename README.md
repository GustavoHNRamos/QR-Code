## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For fonts

### What I learned

During this project i learned how to use hsl and its benefits

Exemple of hsl in use:

```css
.content {
  background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

I don't really understand responsive design yet, so that's what I will focus on for the moment

### Useful resources

- [What is hsl](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl()>) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand hsl. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
